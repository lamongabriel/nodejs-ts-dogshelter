# TypeScript + NodeJS Dog Shelter

Project developed in the B7Web web NodeJS development course.
Thought i'm not using a database and using a template engine that's not used anymore, it's good to practice, this was a project to have some kind of experience using EJS, if I ever stumble upon one of this projects to mantain.

Good one to practice MVC, routing in NodeJS and typing back-end stuff
